### **Assess Your Readiness** (30 minutes)

Ask yourself:

```
Technical Readiness:
□ Can I explain StatefulWidget lifecycle from memory?
□ Can I implement BLoC pattern without reference?
□ Can I design WhatsApp architecture in 45 mins?
□ Can I identify memory leaks in code review?

→ If 3-4 YES: Start applying (Option A)
→ If 1-2 YES: Study for 4-6 weeks first
→ If 0 YES: Deep study for 8-12 weeks

Interview Timeline:
□ Need job urgently (< 1 month) → Aggressive Option A
□ Have 2-3 months → Hybrid Approach (my recommendation)
□ Have 3+ months → Build apps then interview (Option B)
```
