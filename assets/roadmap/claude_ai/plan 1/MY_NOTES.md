### **Assess Your Readiness** (30 minutes)

Ask yourself:

```
Technical Readiness:
□ Can I explain StatefulWidget lifecycle from memory?
□ Can I implement BLoC pattern without reference?
□ Can I design WhatsApp architecture in 45 mins?
□ Can I identify memory leaks in code review?

→ If 3-4 YES: Start applying (Option A)

→ If 0 YES: Deep study for 8-12 weeks

Interview Timeline:
□ Need job urgently (< 1 month) → Aggressive Option A
□ Have 2-3 months → Hybrid Approach (my recommendation)

```
Week 3-6:
✅ Study all interview documents
✅ Practice 50-100 LeetCode problems

### **Phase 3: Apply & Interview (4-6 weeks)**
```
Week 7-12:
✅ Apply to 10-20 companies
