## 🎯 My Recommendation: **Hybrid Approach**

Since you have **6+ years experience** and **10+ apps already**, here's the smartest path:

### **Phase 1: Quick Polish (2 weeks)**

```
Week 1-2:
✅ Pick your BEST existing app
✅ Refactor to Clean Architecture
✅ Add BLoC/Riverpod (document 02)
✅ Optimize performance (document 04)
✅ Add comprehensive tests

Why?
→ You already have apps
→ Just need to demonstrate best practices
→ Creates strong portfolio pieces
```

### **Phase 2: Interview Prep (4-6 weeks)**

```
Week 3-6:
✅ Study all interview documents
✅ Practice 50-100 LeetCode problems
✅ Design 10+ mobile systems
✅ Do 5-10 mock interviews

Why?
→ Documents are ready
→ Focused preparation
→ Ready to interview
```

### **Phase 3: Apply & Interview (4-6 weeks)**

```
Week 7-12:
✅ Apply to 10-20 companies
✅ Do phone screens
✅ Schedule onsites
✅ Negotiate offers

Goal:
→ Land $200K-$500K+ offer
→ By month 3-4
```
