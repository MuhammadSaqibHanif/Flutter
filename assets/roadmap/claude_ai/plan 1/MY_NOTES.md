## 💡 Key Insights from 2024 Interviews

### What Really Matters

**Technical (60%):**

1. Can you code? (35%)

   - Solve LeetCode Medium in 30 minutes
   - Optimal solutions (Big O matters!)
   - Clean, readable code

2. Do you know Flutter deeply? (15%)

   - Widget lifecycle
   - State management
   - Performance optimization

3. Can you design systems? (10%)
   - Mobile architecture
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Scalability thinking

**Non-Technical (40%):**

1. Communication (20%)

   - Think out loud
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Explain your approach

   - Help others grow

3. Impact (10%)
   - Deliver results
   - Own your work
   - Drive projects forward

### Common Rejection Reasons

From real 2024 experiences:

```
❌ "Couldn't solve coding problem optimally"
   → Practice more LeetCode

❌ "Didn't communicate approach clearly"
   → Think out loud, explain reasoning

❌ "Weak system design skills"
   → Practice 20+ system design problems

❌ "Couldn't explain past work impact"
   → Prepare STAR stories with metrics

❌ "Poor performance optimization knowledge"
   → Study document 04 deeply
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Preparation Effectiveness Check

After each study session, ask:

```
Can I...
✅ Explain StatefulWidget lifecycle from memory?
✅ Implement BLoC pattern without reference?
✅ Design WhatsApp in 45 minutes?
✅ Identify memory leaks in code?
✅ Explain my past projects with STAR method?

If yes to all → Ready for interviews!
If no to any → More practice needed
```

🔍 Read comments - they explain WHY

For Theory (Afternoon):

📖 Read actively - reference your morning code
🗣️ Explain out loud - record yourself
✍️ Write notes - in your own words
🔗 Connect concepts - how do they relate?

For Quiz (Evening):

⏱️ Time yourself - simulate interview pressure
🚫 No cheating - test real knowledge
📝 Review mistakes - understand why wrong
🔄 Retry if needed - aim for 18+/20
