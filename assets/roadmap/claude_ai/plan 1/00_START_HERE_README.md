   - Solve LeetCode Medium in 30 minutes
   - Optimal solutions (Big O matters!)
   - Clean, readable code

2. Do you know Flutter deeply? (15%)

   - Widget lifecycle
   - State management
   - Performance optimization

3. Can you design systems? (10%)
   - Mobile architecture
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Scalability thinking

**Non-Technical (40%):**

1. Communication (20%)

   - Think out loud
   - Ask clarifying questions

### Common Rejection Reasons

From real 2024 experiences:

```
❌ "Couldn't solve coding problem optimally"
   → Practice more LeetCode

❌ "Didn't communicate approach clearly"
   → Think out loud, explain reasoning

❌ "Weak system design skills"
   → Practice 20+ system design problems

❌ "Couldn't explain past work impact"
   → Prepare STAR stories with metrics

❌ "Poor performance optimization knowledge"
   → Study document 04 deeply
```

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Target Scores (Google Style)

```
You need:
✅ Average ≥ 3.3 across all rounds
✅ No round < 2.5
✅ At least one 4.0 (strong yes)

How to get there:
- 3.0: Solve problems (may need hints)
- 3.5: Solve optimally (minor hints ok)
- 4.0: Solve optimally without hints + excellent communication
```

### Preparation Effectiveness Check

After each study session, ask:

```
Can I...
✅ Explain StatefulWidget lifecycle from memory?
✅ Implement BLoC pattern without reference?
✅ Design WhatsApp in 45 minutes?
✅ Identify memory leaks in code?
✅ Explain my past projects with STAR method?

If yes to all → Ready for interviews!
If no to any → More practice needed
```
