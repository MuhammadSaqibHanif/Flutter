### Negotiation Tips

Based on real successful negotiations from Blind:

```
Situation: Multiple offers
Google: $280K base + $420K stock
Meta: $270K base + $350K stock
Startup: $300K base + $600K paper equity

Strategy:
1. Got competing offers BEFORE negotiating
2. Showed written offer letters (when asked)
3. Emphasized preference for Google but...
4. Asked: "Can you help me make this an easy decision?"

Result:
Google increased to:
$265K base + 20% bonus + $420K stock + $50K signing
Total: $780K first year

Lesson: Competing offers are CRUCIAL for negotiation
```

**Negotiation Framework:**

```
1. Never give numbers first
   "What's your target?"
   → "I'm flexible, what's the budget for this role?"

2. Always have competing offers
   Even if you prefer one company

3. Show enthusiasm but...
   "I'm very excited about Google, AND I need to make sure
    this works financially for my family"

4. Ask for specific things
   ✅ "Can you increase the signing bonus to $80K?"
   ❌ "Can you do better?"

5. Be ready to walk away
   Sometimes necessary for best outcome
```

## 💡 Interview Tips from Successful Candidates

### Do's ✅

```
1. Think Out Loud
   "I'm thinking of using a HashMap because..."
   Interviewers can't read your mind!

2. Ask Clarifying Questions
   "Can I assume the input is sorted?"
   "What's the expected size of the data?"
   Shows you think about edge cases

3. Start with Brute Force
   "The naive solution would be O(n²), but we can optimize..."
   Shows problem-solving process

4. Explain Trade-offs
   "We could use BLoC for better testability, but Provider
    is simpler and sufficient for this use case"

5. Test Your Code
   Walk through with example inputs
   Consider edge cases

6. Be Honest
   "I don't know X, but here's how I'd approach learning it"
   Better than making things up

7. Show Enthusiasm
   Companies want people who WANT to work there
```

### Don'ts ❌

```
1. Don't Stay Silent
   Interviewer has no idea what you're thinking

2. Don't Jump to Code
   Understand the problem first
   Discuss approach before coding

3. Don't Ignore Hints
   Interviewers give hints to help you!
   "Have you considered using a HashMap?"

4. Don't Say "That's Easy"
   Even if it is. Stay humble.

5. Don't Bad-mouth Previous Companies
   Shows unprofessionalism

6. Don't Give Up
   "I'm stuck" → "Let me think about this differently..."

7. Don't Neglect Behavioral Prep
   Technical skills aren't enough
```

```

### Example Answer (Meta E5 Interview)

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you had to make a technical trade-off"

**Answer:**

```
Situation:
I was leading the development of our Flutter app which needed
offline support. We had 3 options: SQLite, Hive, or Isar.

Task:
Choose the right database that would:
- Support complex queries (we had 10+ tables)
- Perform well (app already had performance issues)
- Be maintainable by our team

Action:
I created a spike for each option:
1. Benchmarked performance with our actual data
2. Assessed learning curve for team
3. Evaluated migration complexity

Results:
- SQLite: Slower queries but team knew SQL
- Hive: Fastest but limited query capabilities
- Isar: Best performance + query support but newest

Decision: Isar
- 3x faster than SQLite in our tests
- Full query support unlike Hive
- Risk: Newer library, but community was active

Result:
- App queries 3x faster
- Reduced offline sync time by 60%
- Team learned Isar in 1 week
- No issues in 6 months of production

Learning:
- Data-driven decisions beat assumptions
- Consider team capabilities in tech choices
- Sometimes newer tech is worth the risk
