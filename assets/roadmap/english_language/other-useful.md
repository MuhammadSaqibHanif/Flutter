30-day English Speaking Plan (movie-first, job-focused)




Core techniques (simple and practical)
- No-translation trick: Speak using simple English words you already know. If a word is missing, describe it. Example: “I used a thing to connect two parts” instead of stopping to translate “connector.”
- 4-step scene method (Loop-EARS)
 1) Watch 1–2 minutes with English subtitles at 0.75–1.0x speed.
 2) Extract 8–12 useful chunks (not single words): “I’m responsible for…”, “Could you clarify…?”
 3) Repeat lines with the actor (shadowing). Record yourself.
 4) Speak: summarize the scene and role-play without reading.
- Think-in-English micro-drills (2 minutes): Name items in the room, describe your last task, or explain your plan for today. Only English.
- 4-3-2 speaking drill: Say the same answer in 4 minutes, then 3, then 2. You will get faster and more fluent.
- Confidence: 4-4-6 breathing (4 in, 4 hold, 6 out) + “smile voice.” Record, listen, and note one thing you did well.

Reduce Urdu-to-English translation (practical drills)

- Paraphrase game: If a word is missing, describe it: “It’s like…”, “It’s used for…”, “Another way to say it is…”
- Visual memory: When you learn a chunk, attach a mental picture to it (not an Urdu word).
- English dictionary only: Check meanings and examples in English (learner’s dictionaries have simple explanations).
- Fillers to keep flow: “Let me think…”, “What’s the word…?”, “So basically…”


Confidence builders
- 4-4-6 breathing before speaking; stand tall; slight smile
- Record small wins daily (one good phrase you used)
- Mirror talk: 2 minutes looking at yourself; strong eye contact; slow pace
- Positive loop: After each session, say out loud: “I improved my English today.”


If movies feel too hard (backup plan)
- Switch for 3–5 days to graded content with transcripts:
 - VOA Learning English (slow news)
 - BBC Learning English (Business English)
 - Plain English Podcast (with transcripts)
 - Business English Pod (interviews, meetings)
- Use shorter clips:
 - TED-Ed (5 minutes, clear language)
 - Company product videos (YouTube) for your industry
- Pronunciation apps: ELSA Speak or Speechling (coach feedback)
- Speaking partner: italki or HelloTalk (15-minute daily calls)
- Maintain the same daily structure (watch → extract chunks → shadow → speak)


How to track progress (simple)
- Daily: number of new chunks (aim 8–12); minutes spoken; 1 recording
- Weekly: complete milestone tasks; check how many chunks you used naturally
- Rubric (0–2 each): Fluency (speed/pauses), Clarity (pronunciation), Vocabulary (variety), Structure (STAR), Confidence (voice/eye contact). Target: 8+/10 by Day 28.


Quick subtitle strategy
- Pass 1: English subtitles, slow speed (0.75–1.0x)
- Pass 2: No subtitles, normal speed
- Pass 3: Shadowing lines with subtitles only for tricky parts
- Avoid Urdu subtitles. Use English-only environment for these 90 minutes.


Minimum plan on very busy days (15–20 minutes)
- 2 min: breathing + think-aloud
- 8 min: one short clip (60–90 seconds) + 3 chunks
- 5 min: shadow the lines
- 3–5 min: answer one interview question with 4-3-2 drill


Expected result after 30 days
- You will know 240–300 job-ready chunks by heart
- You can speak 6–8 minutes in a mock interview with clear structure
- You can handle small talk, status updates, polite requests, and feedback
- You will depend less on Urdu because you can paraphrase quickly in English


You’ve got this. Keep sessions consistent. Speak out loud every day. Focus on chunks, not single words. Use the scenes as your “mini-classroom,” and bring those phrases directly into your interview answers and workplace talk.
