## 🎤 STEP 6: EVENING RECORDING - Two Parts! (20 minutes)

Record yourself asking these questions naturally:

2. "What do you mean by 'refactoring'?"
3. "When is our next team meeting?"
4. "How do I access the database?"

Remember: Voice goes UP at the end! ↗️

**Part B: Answer a Question (15 minutes)**

**Question:** "Tell me about a technical problem you solved recently"

**Your answer should include:**
- What was the problem?
- How did you find the solution?
- What did you learn?

**Example:**

"Last month, we had a bug in our application where users couldn't log in. The error message was confusing and didn't help us find the problem.

First, I checked the error logs in our monitoring system. Then I debugged the authentication code line by line. I found that the problem was in the JWT token validation function. The token was expiring too quickly.

I fixed the issue by increasing the token expiration time and adding better error handling. Then I tested the solution thoroughly. After deployment, the login problem was solved.

From this experience, I learned to always check the logs first and to add clear error messages in the code. I also learned about JWT token security best practices."

**Your turn - speak for 3-4 minutes about YOUR problem!**

✅ **Recorded both parts?** Check: [✅]

## 💼 STEP 7: INTERVIEW PRACTICE (10 minutes)

**Q1:** "How do you handle tight deadlines?"

**Practice:**
"When I have a tight deadline, I follow these steps: First, I analyze the requirements and break the work into smaller tasks. Then I prioritize the most important features. I focus on one task at a time and avoid distractions. If I face any blocker, I immediately ask my team for help. I also communicate with my manager about the progress regularly. This approach helps me deliver quality work even under pressure."

**Q2:** "Tell me about your teamwork experience"

**Practice:**
"I work in a team of [number] developers. We follow Agile methodology with daily stand-up meetings. Every morning, we share what we did yesterday, what we'll do today, and if we have any blockers.

We help each other when someone faces a technical challenge. We do code reviews to maintain code quality. We use Slack for communication and Jira for project management.

I believe good communication is the key to successful teamwork. When we communicate openly and help each other, we can solve any problem."
